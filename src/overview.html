      This is a fork of the JSON project in github (https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java) for the 20180813 version.
      
      <P>
      Compared to this implementation:
      <ul>
         <li>this is a Netbeans project</li>
         <li>JSONObject and JSONArray both have an equals and hashCode method</li>
         <li>a FileUtils class with static method has been added to simply the generation to/from a File / a JSON object</li>
         <li>The supported Java version is Java 8</li>
      </ul>

      <H1>Overview</H1>
      JSON is a light-weight, language independent, data interchange format. See http://www.JSON.org/
      
      <P>
      The files in this package implement JSON encoders/decoders in Java.
      It also includes the capability to convert between JSON and XML, HTTP
      headers, Cookies, and CDL.

      <P>
      This is a reference implementation. There is a large number of JSON packages
      in Java. Perhaps someday the Java community will standardize on one. Until
      then, choose carefully.

      <P>
      The license includes this restriction: "The software shall be used for good,
      not evil." If your conscience cannot live with that, then choose a different
      package.

      <P>
      The package compiles on Java 1.8.

      <H1>Code structure</H1>
      <ul>
         <li>JSONObject.java: The JSONObject can parse text from a String or a JSONTokener
            to produce a map-like object. The object provides methods for manipulating its
            contents, and for producing a JSON compliant object serialization.</li>
         <li>JSONArray.java: The JSONArray can parse text from a String or a JSONTokener
            to produce a vector-like object. The object provides methods for manipulating
            its contents, and for producing a JSON compliant array serialization.</li>
         <li>JSONTokener.java: The JSONTokener breaks a text into a sequence of individual
            tokens. It can be constructed from a String, Reader, or InputStream</li>
         <li>JSONException.java: The JSONException is the standard exception type thrown by this package.</li>
         <li>JSONPointer.java: Implementation of [JSON Pointer (RFC 6901)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901). Supports
            JSON Pointers both in the form of string representation and URI fragment representation.</li>
         <li>JSONPropertyIgnore.java: Annotation class that can be used on Java Bean getter methods.
            When used on a bean method that would normally be serialized into a JSONObject, it
            overrides the getter-to-key-name logic and forces the property to be excluded from the
            resulting JSONObject.</li>
         <li>JSONPropertyName.java: Annotation class that can be used on Java Bean getter methods.
            When used on a bean method that would normally be serialized into a JSONObject, it
            overrides the getter-to-key-name logic and uses the value of the annotation. The Bean
            processor will look through the class hierarchy. This means you can use the annotation on
            a base class or interface and the value of the annotation will be used even if the getter
            is overridden in a child class. </li>
         <li>JSONString.java: The JSONString interface requires a toJSONString method,
            allowing an object to provide its own serialization.</li>
         <li>JSONStringer.java: The JSONStringer provides a convenient facility for
            building JSON strings.</li>
         <li>JSONWriter.java: The JSONWriter provides a convenient facility for building
            JSON text through a writer.</li>
         <li>CDL.java: CDL provides support for converting between JSON and comma delimited lists.</li>
         <li>Cookie.java: Cookie provides support for converting between JSON and cookies.</li>
         <li>CookieList.java: CookieList provides support for converting between JSON and cookie lists.</li>
         <li>HTTP.java: HTTP provides support for converting between JSON and HTTP headers.</li>
         <li>XML.java: XML provides support for converting between JSON and XML.</li>
      </ul>

      <H1>About numeric types</H1>
      Numeric types in this package comply with
      [ECMA-404: The JSON Data Interchange Format](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-404.pdf) and
      [RFC 7159: The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159#section-6).
      This package fully supports `Integer`, `Long`, and `Double` Java types. Partial support
      for `BigInteger` and `BigDecimal` values in `JSONObject` and `JSONArray` objects is provided
      in the form of `get()`, `opt()`, and `put()` API methods.
      
      <P>
      In compliance with RFC7159 page 10 section 9, the parser is more lax with what is valid
      JSON than the Generator. For Example, the tab character (U+0009) is allowed when reading
      JSON Text strings, but when output by the Generator, tab is properly converted to \t in
      the string. Other instances may occur where reading invalid JSON text does not cause an
      error to be generated. Malformed JSON Texts such as missing end " (quote) on strings or
      invalid number formats (1.2e6.3) will cause errors as such documents can not be read
      reliably.
